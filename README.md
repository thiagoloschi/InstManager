### Description
(Under Instagram review) InstManager is an Instagram client created with the unique purpose of entertaining Instagram users by providing cool insights and usage statistics from their Instagram accounts. Users will be able to see which of their friends follow them back and will have the ability to follow and unfollow other users.
<br /> 

### Technologies
This application utilizes node.js, express.js, mongodb and angular.js among other technologies.
<br />

### Status
InstManager is now running in SandBox mode while is being reviewed by Instagram.
<br /> 

### Website
Although the application is already live at http://instmanager.herokuapp.com, Instagram still needs to review it before it can be used by Instagram users. By now, only SandBox users can utilize InstManager.

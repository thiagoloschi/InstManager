<p>InstManager is now running in SandBox mode while is being reviewed by Instagram.</p><br/>

<li><h3>Website</h3></li>
<p>Although the application is already live at http://instmanager.herokuapp.com, Instagram still needs to review it before it can be used by Instagram users. By now, only SandBox users can utilize InstManager.</p><br/>
